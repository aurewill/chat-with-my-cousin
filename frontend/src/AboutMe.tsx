                        Hi, I'm Parker! I live in North Carolina with my wife and cat. 
                        We have a nice life - Connie will clean my clothes while I roll around with that kitty. 
                        I'm a military man, through and through. Sometimes I think I was born for what I do, 
                        where other times I feel that I was born to be under the bright lights, performing Hairspray 
                        with the boys. Who knows what the future has in store for my family. 
                        However, one thing I do know, is that this kitty needs his daddy! üòù
